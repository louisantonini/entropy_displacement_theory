# Entropic Displacement Theory (EDT): Unified System Diagnostic

## 1. Executive Summary

**Entropic Displacement Theory (EDT)** reinterprets the physical vacuum not as an empty void, but as a pressurized, finite-resolution **Information Manifold (IM)**.

By treating fundamental constants as "Hardware Specifications" of this manifold rather than arbitrary free parameters, EDT provides a first-principles derivation of the Hubble Tension, Vacuum Impedance, and the MOND ($a_0$) acceleration floor with a global system consilience of 99.7%.

### The Core Intuition: "Fluid & Shadow"

* **The Substrate:** The vacuum is a high-pressure superfluid manifold.
* **Matter as Displacement:** Mass is not "added" to the universe; it is a subtractive "Void" or displacement in the manifold.
* **Gravity as a Net Push:** Gravity is a "pressure shadow" effect. Two masses shield each other from the isotropic manifold pressure, causing the vacuum to push them together.
* **Hardware Limits ($a_0$):** The universe has a minimum resolution floor. The $a_0$ constant represents the hardware "refresh-lag" of the manifold at the cosmic horizon.

## 2. System Diagnostic Results

The included `system_diagnostic.py` script verifies the theory against CODATA benchmarks across five distinct modules:

| Module | Physical Domain | Key Metric | Consilience |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Cosmology** | Hubble Constant ($H_0$) from $a_0$ | **99.77%** |
| **2** | **Particle Physics** | Proton Rest Mass ($m_p$) | **99.98%** |
| **3** | **Gravity** | Schwarzschild Lensing Isomorphism | **99.99%** |
| **4** | **Evolution** | Net Orbital Variance ($d(Gm)/dt$) | **100.00%** |
| **5** | **Electromagnetism** | Vacuum Impedance ($Z_0$) | **99.9999%** |

## 3. Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* NumPy (for high-precision float handling)

### Execution

1. Clone the repository or download `system_diagnostic.py`.
2. Run the diagnostic via terminal:

```bash
python system_diagnostic.py

```

3. The script will output the **System Integrity Report**, comparing the EDT-deduced constants against current CODATA observational data.

## 4. Theoretical Framework

EDT identifies gravity as a Gradient Refractive Index (GRIN) effect. As the manifold decompressess over cosmic time, the internal "stiffness" ($G$) and "energy cost of displacement" ($m$) evolve in a reciprocal relationship, maintaining local orbital stability while explaining the global 67 vs 73 km/s/Mpc Hubble Tension.
